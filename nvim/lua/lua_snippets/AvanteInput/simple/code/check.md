- Enhance code clarity and readability by refining variable names, simplifying expressions, and improving structure, without adding extra lines unless necessary.
- Identify and fix any deviations from industry best practices regarding style, structure, and maintainability.
- Detect potential code smells or anti-patterns and suggest succinct improvements.
- Ensure consistency in formatting, naming conventions, and comment usage.
